# Android Scan QR Code Library Samples
This repository is a small collection of QR code scanning libraries which are all done in jetpack compose! The suite offers:
* [ML Kit + CameraX](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/barcode-scanning/android)
* [Zxing-Android-Embedded](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded)
* [Code Scanner](https://github.com/yuriy-budiyev/code-scanner)

Only libraries that allowed for view based implementations were considered!
